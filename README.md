# MovieRecommendations

This was a turtorial project I followed on Youtube to get me more familar with Pandas, NumPy, and different machine learning libraries that can be used within Python.

# Overview

Given a movie.csv and a ratings.csv, Pandas, NumPy, and skLearn are used to search for movies given an user input. Using the same imports, movie recommendations can be given to a user based off of their movie title input. Jupyter Notebook was also used to create this project.
